#0001 The system shall be able to determine if a triangle is scalene, equilateral or isosceles
#0002 The system shall accept three triangle sides as length in either float or integers
#0003 The system shall be able to determine the type of quadrilateral based on 4 sides and 4 angles
#0004 The system shall accept quadrilateral sides as floats or integers

** questions
#0006 The system shall accept questions in the form of strings and attempt to answer them
#0007 The system shall answer questions that begin with one of the following valid question keywords: "How", "What", "Where", "Why" and "Who"
#0008 If the system does not detect a valid question keyword it shall return "Was that a question?"
#0009 If the system does not detect a question mark at end of the string it shall return "Was that a question?"

A question mark is defined as ASCII value 0x3F

**Determining Answers**

#0010 The system shall break a question down into words separated by space
#0011 The system shall determine an answer to a question as a correct if the keywords provide a 90% match and return the answer
#0012 The system shall exclude any number value from match code and provide the values to generator function (if one exists)
#0013 When a valid match is determined the system shall return the answer
#0014 When no valid match is determined the system shall return "I don't know, please provide the answer"

**Providing Answers**

#0015 The system shall provide a means of providing an answer to the previously asked question.
#0016 The system shall accept and store answers to previous questions in the form of a string or a function pointer and store it as the generator function.
#0017 If no previous question has been asked the system shall respond with "Please ask a question first"
#0018 If an attempt is made to provide an answer to an already answered question the system shall respond with "I don\'t know about that. I was taught differently" and not update the question

**Correcting Answers**

#0019 The system shall provide a means of updating an answer to the previously asked question.
#0020 The system shall accept and store answers to previous questions in the form of a string or a function pointer and store it as the generator function.
#0021 If no previous question has been asked the system shall respond with "Please ask a question first"


for example When I ask "What time is it?" I want to be given the current date/time so I can stay up to date
for example When I ask "What is the n digit of fibonacci?" I want to receive the answer so I don't have to figure it out myself
for example When I ask "What is the n digit of pi?" I want to receive the answer so I don't have to figure it out myself
for example When I ask "Please clear memory" I want the application to clear user set questions and answers so I can reset the application
for example When I say "Open the door hal", I want the application to say "I'm afraid I can't do that <user name>" so I know that is not an option
for example When I ask "Convert <number> <units> to <units>" I want to receive the converted value and units so I can know the answer.
for example When I ask for a numeric conversion I want "at least 10 different units" I can convert from/to
for example when I ask "Convert <number> <set of units where at least one is not included>" I want the system to respond with "units are not recognized"
for example when I ask "Why did the chicken cross the road?" I want the application to respond with "To prove to the armadillo that it can be done" so I can get a chuckle.
for example when I ask "What is the <negative number> digit of fibonacci?" I want the system to respond "I cannot process a negative number" so that I realize my error.
for example when I say "What is the <negative number or zero> digit of pi?" I want the system to respond with "The number must be greater than zero".
for example when I ask "What is n multiplied by m?" I want the system to return n * m so I don't have to locate the calculator.
for example when I ask "What student really deserves an A?" I want the system to say "Kirt Stark does!"
for example when I ask "Question with no strings, maybe just numbers" the system will raise an exception that 'Not A String!' so I know that I need to enter a string.
for example when I ask "Long Question with too many paramenters" the system will raise an exception that 'Too many extra parameters' so I know what the error is.
for example when I ask "Convert <string number value> <units> to <units>" I really want the system to respond with "error in number value" so I understand why it didn't work
for example when I ask "Convert <number> <units> to <units> with extra words" I want the system to respond with "incorrect number of words in conversion question" so I know why it didn't work

!! this requirement is only to complete the coverage for a command statement that does not attach to a function.
for example when I ask "Hal, take the garbage out." I want the system to respond with "I am busy right now, you do it." so I know it is my job, and not his.


!! these requirements are for lab 3
for example when I ask "What is the cube of n?" I want Hal to return the number cubed so I can calculate volumes of cubes.
for example when I ask "What is the mass of a measure of <material> with a volume of <number> cubic meters?" I want Hal to calculate the mass in kilograms and return it so I know how heavy a product will be.
for example when I ask "How many times will n divide completely into m?" I want Hal to return the number of times the second number divides into the first so I don't need to buy a calculator.
for example when I ask "How many times will 0 divide completely into m?" I want Hal to return that "division by zero is not possible!"
for example when I ask "How many times will n divide completely into 0?" I want Hal to return that "that is infinite"
for example when I ask "What is n when it is multiplied by m and then added to x?" I want Hal to calculate the amount for me so I can figure my paycheck each week.
for example when I ask "Why are these labs such a struggle for me?" I want Hal to give me a suggestion as to why so that I can improve my performance.

!! here are the stories from lab 5

#0100 The system shall return 'Yes' or 'No' when asked 'Is the <file path> in the repo?'
#0101 The system shall return one of the following when asked 'What is the status of <file path>?'

         - <file path> has been modified locally

         - <file path> has not been checked in

         - <file path> is a dirty repo

         - <file path> is up to date

#0102 The system shall return '<hash>, <date modified>, <author>' when asked 'What is the deal with <file path>?'
